# Computational project cookie cutter
# What it does: This script creates a directory structure and documentation files for a new computational project.
# How to use it: Type "bash comp_proj_creator" and the root directory containing all other directories and files will be called new_project.

# First, create the root directory for the entire project and names it new_project 
mkdir new_project

# Next, create an empty file name LICENSE.md in the root directory
touch new_project/LICENSE.md

# Next, create the 5 main directories within the root directory, and the files and directories within in them

# First, create the planning directory for notes and miscellaneous files including a notebook document
mkdir new_project/planning
# Create a notebook document for documenting the process of this project
touch new_project/planning/notebook.txt
# Now, create a README.md document that explains this directory
echo "This directory is for miscellaneous files, notes, objectives, etc. It also contains the notebook, which is for chronological entries throughout the project process including observations, ideas, failures, links, images, tables, etc." > new_project/planning/README.md
 
# Second, create the data directory for storing fixed data sets
mkdir new_project/data
# Now create a README.md for the data directory that explains what the data directory is used for
echo "This directory is for storing data sets." > new_project/data/README.md

# Third, create the results directory, two subdirectories (tables and plots), and a README.md for each
mkdir new_project/results 
echo "This directory is for storing all results, and is organized into two subdirectories: tables and plots." > new_project/results/README.md
mkdir new_project/results/tables.txt
echo "This subdirectory is for all results that are in the form of tables and should be organized chronologically." > new_project/results/tables.txt/README.md
mkdir new_project/results/plots.txt
echo "This subdirectory is for all results that are in the form of plots and should be organized chronologically." > new_project/results/plots.txt/README.md

# Fourth, create the src directory, two subdirectories (scripts and lib), and a README.md for each
mkdir new_project/src
echo "This directory is for storing all code used in this project" > new_project/src/README.md
mkdir new_project/src/scripts
echo "This subdirectory is for storing all scripts created by me in this project" > new_project/src/scripts/REAME.md
mkdir new_project/src/lib
echo "This subdirectory is for storing all codes reused from other projects" > new_project/src/lib/README.md


# Fifth, create the doc directory
mkdir new_project/doc
# Now, create the documents within this directory
# Now, create a README.md document that explains this directory
echo "This directory is for the manuscript, all final figures and data, references, etc." > new_project/doc/README.md"
